## Deploying the Portfolio

To deploy your portfolio, you can use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any hosting service of your choice. Here are general steps to deploy on GitHub Pages:

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

   - For deploying to the root domain (https://your-username.github.io/), set the `base` option in `vite.config.js` to `''`.

   - For deploying to a custom domain (https://www.example.com/), set the `base` option to `'/your-repo-name/'` in `vite.config.js`.

   - Commit the changes and push to the `main` branch.

3. Go to your GitHub repository settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the branch where the build files are located (usually `main` branch).

4. Your portfolio will be available at the specified URL after a few minutes.
